# Using containers

Containers address the issue of software and dependency complexity by storing the 
application, its dependencies, and a minimal operating system in a single, portable 
**image file**. This image runs directly on top of the host machine's Linux kernel, 
providing a lightweight, reproducible, and flexible computing environment.

Containers provide several key benefits for scientific computing:

- **Flexibility (BYOE/BYOS):** Bring your own environment and software stack, regardless 
of what's natively installed on the host system.
- **Reproducibility:** Guarantee the exact software versions and library dependencies 
used for your research results.
- **Portability:** Run the exact same image on your local machine or on large-scale HPC 
systems.
- **Performance:** Containers run with near-native application speed.
- **Compatibility:** Supported across most modern Linux distributions.

The container platform available on Roar is `apptainer` (formerly Singularity).

!!! note "Container support"
    Docker and Docker Compose are not supported due to privilege restrictions.
    Apptainer can run Docker images, but does not support Docker Compose or multi-container orchestration.


## Building containers

### Using vs. building containers

This guide focuses solely on **using and running** pre-built containers on Roar. 
Building a complex or customized container image is an advanced topic that is not covered 
comprehensively here.

### Notice on building containers

Building an Apptainer image from a definition file (``apptainer build <image> <definition>``) 
**cannot be done on Roar**. Building requires **root (administrative) privileges**, which 
are not available to non-administrative users on ICDS systems.

- You must build your containers on a dedicated, appropriate machine (e.g., your personal 
workstation or a cloud service) where you have full **root access**.
- After building, you can transfer the resulting .sif image file to Roar.

### Building and sandbox alternatives

While full image builds are restricted, Apptainer offers a sandbox option for development. 
To build a writable "sandbox" directory from an existing container image for experimentation 
and modification:

```
apptainer build --sandbox <sandbox_directory> <container_image>
```

!!! warning "Use /tmp for sandbox or build directories"
    Container build or sandbox directories **must not** use the 
    **Scratch filesystem (/scratch/\$USER)**, as use of scratch may
    result in container corruption. Use of the `/tmp` directory is
    encouraged as an alternative.
    
    When using `/tmp`, note that when the job ends, the `/tmp` directory
	is automatically deleted.

## Common Apptainer commands

Containers can either be downloaded from a public repository or transferred after being 
built elsewhere. Here are the most common Apptainer commands used:

 - `apptainer pull <resource>://<container>` - Downloads a container image from a remote 
 registry (e.g., Sylabs Cloud, Docker Hub) and converts it to the native Apptainer (.sif) 
 format. For example, `apptainer pull docker://ubuntu:20.04`.
 - `apptainer shell <container>` - Runs an interactive shell inside the container for 
 debugging or setup. For example, `apptainer shell my_image.sif`
 - `apptainer exec <container> <command>` - Executes a single command inside the container 
 without dropping you into a shell. For example, `apptainer exec my_image.sif python script.py`
 - `apptainer run <container>` - Executes the container's predefined **runscript**, 
 which is often the main application entry point. For example, `apptainer run my_app.sif --input data.txt` 
 
## Accessing storage within a container

A notable feature of Apptainer on ICDS systems is that the container environment automatically
 **shares (binds)** several critical directories from the host system:

- Your Home directory: `/storage/home/\$USER`
- Your Work directory: `/storage/work/\$USER`
- Group directories: `/storage/group`
- The Scratch filesystem: `/scratch/\$USER`
- The temporary directory: `/tmp`

This seamless binding means you can read and write files directly between your containerized 
application and your standard HPC storage locations.

## Module conflicts and environment

When using containers, be aware of potential **module conflicts** with the host system:

!!! warning Do not load environment modules on the host (Roar) that are intended to be used _inside_ 
the container.
    This can lead to unexpected errors or the use of unintended or unexpected software versions.
	
	For example, if you load an **R** module on the host system, the host's **R 
	library path** will often be exposed to and prioritized by the container, overriding 
	the container's built-in R libraries. 

!!! tip "Use `module purge` to avoid unintended conflicts
    Run a `module purge` in your batch script _before_ starting the container to ensure a 
    clean host environment.

## Containers with Slurm

### Running non-MPI containers

The apptainer run or apptainer exec command is used directly in your Slurm batch script.

```
# !/bin/bash

# SBATCH --job-name=ContainerJob

# Run the containerized application
apptainer run /storage/work/\$USER/images/my_app.sif --input data.in
```

### Running parallel (MPI) applications

To run parallel code, Apptainer must use the **host system's MPI library** and 
infrastructure to launch processes. This requires that the host MPI version be compatible 
with (and ideally newer than) the MPI library packaged inside the container.

Consult the **apptainer and MPI Applications** documentation for specific compatibility 
requirements.

```
# !/bin/bash
# SBATCH --job-name=MPIContainer
# SBATCH --ntasks=32

# Load the host's MPI module for process launching
module load openmpi/4.1.5

# Use srun with apptainer exec to launch a parallel command
srun --mpi=pmix apptainer exec /storage/work/\$USER/images/my_mpi_code.sif /usr/bin/my_parallel_executable
```

!!! important "MPI compatibility"
    The container must be built using the same MPI as selected on the host via the module load.
    
    In this example, the container should be built with OpenMPI 4.1.5 with pmix support.
    
    If there is a version of mpi type mismatch, the job could lock up or run as a set of
    singleton jobs (multiple copies of a single processor job).

!!! tip "Ask for help"
    Due to the complexities of running containerized MPI jobs across nodes, it is recommended
    that you [first contact ICDS](mailto:idcs@psu.edu) for assistance prior to starting.

## Apptainer cache

Apptainer automatically uses a directory `.apptainer`, located in your ***$HOME*** directory. 
As home directories on ICDS systems are small, you may wish to use an alternate location of 
the apptainer cache.

You can set this location via the environment variable ***APPTAINER_CACHEDIR***, setting it 
to an alternate location such as your ***WORK*** directory.

```
export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=/storage/work/$USER
```

You should regularly clean your cache by running the command `apptainer cache clean`. 

!!! note "Clear your cache using dry-run"
    You can first see what file will be cleaned by using the `--dry-run option` to the clean command.
