# Batch jobs

For compute jobs that take hours or days to run,
instead of sitting at the terminal waiting for the results,
we submit a "batch job" to the workload manager,
which runs the job when resources are available.

## Slurm commands

On Roar, the queue manager is Slurm (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management).  
Besides `salloc` for [interactive jobs](interactive-jobs.md)),
the basic Slurm commands are:

| Command | Effect|
| ---- | ---- | 
| `sbatch <script>` | submit batch job `<script>` | 
| `squeue -u <userid>` | check on jobs submitted by `<userid>` |
| `scancel <jobID>` | cancel the job | 

When you execute `sbatch myJob.sh`, Slurm responds with something like
```
Submitted batch job 25789352
```
To check on your jobs, execute `squeue -u <userID>`; Slurm responds with something like
```
JOBID		PARTITION	NAME		USER	ST	TIME	NODES	NODELIST(REASON)
25789352	open 		myJob.sh	abc123	R	1:18:31	1		p-sc-2008
```
Here ST = status:  PD = pending, R = running, C = completed.  
To cancel the job, execute `scancel 25789352`.

## Batch scripts

Jobs submitted to Slurm are in the form of a "batch script". 
A batch script is a shell script that executes commands, 
with a preamble of Slurm [resource directives](slurm-scheduler.md/#resource-directives) 
`#SBATCH...` to specify

- a **Slurm account id** to charge;
- a **partition** (type of nodes) to run on;
- nodes, cores, memory, GPUs, and time;
- and other job-related parameters.

For more information on partitions, see [Partitions](../system/system-overview.md/#partitions).  
For more information on resource requests, see [Resource requests][resource-requests].
[resource-requests]: resource-requests.md

An example batch script:

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=account_id
#SBATCH --partition=basic
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=8
#SBATCH --mem=1gb
#SBATCH --time=4:00:00
#SBATCH --job-name=example-job
#SBATCH --output=example-job.%j.out

# load software
module load python/3.11.2

python3 myscript.py
```

!!! tip "To use a paid allocation, use --partition=sla-prio"
	Jobs under a paid allocation do not specify the basic, standard,
	high-memory, or interactive partitions.
	Instead, --partition=sla-prio tells the job
	to use the hardware in your allocation.


The first line `#!/bin/bash` is the "shebang", which says the script 
should be run under `bash` (a Linux shell).
Everything after the last `#SBATCH` are commands to be executed;
lines with `#` other than `#SBATCH` are ordinary bash script comments.

### Arguments in batch scripts

`sbatch` can pass arguments to batch scripts like this:

```
sbatch myScript.sh arg1 arg2
```

In the script, arguments `arg1` and `arg2` can be accessed with `$1` and `$2` as usual:

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=account_id
...

python3 myscript.py $1 $2
```
  
`sbatch` can also pass values by assigning variables like this:
```
sbatch --export=VAR1=arg1, VAR2=arg2 myScript.sh
```

In the script, `$VAR1` and `$VAR2` are set to `arg1` and `arg2`.

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=account_id
...

python3 myscript.py $VAR1 $VAR2
```

### Batch Script Examples

ICDS offers a curated repository of example submit scripts for many of our 
most popular software packages, including StarCCM, COMSOL, MATLAB, R, python, and more.

## Estimating resource usage

For credit accounts, it is helpful to estimate how many credits a batch job would use
before you actually run it. For this, use `job_estimate`:

```
job_estimate <submit file>
```

which reports the cost in credits.
For more on `job_estimate`, execute `job_estimate --help`.

Additionally, for users who schedule jobs interactively through the portal, an estimate of the credits required for the job is displayed near the Launch button once you select your batch options and partition. This estimate updates dynamically based on your selections, allowing you to understand the approximate credit cost before starting the job.

The Slurm command [`sacct`][sacct]
reports the resources used by a completed batch job,
which helps users learn what resources to request next time.
At the bottom of a batch script, the command
[sacct]: https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html

```
sacct -j $SLURM_JOB_ID --format=JobID,JobName,MaxRSS,Elapsed,TotalCPU,State
```

generates a report in the batch output file of resources used. Using the 
`--format` flag controls what content is displayed. See `sacct --helpformat` 
for more formatting options.

### Selecting nodes and cores

Choosing the right number of cores (--ntasks) and nodes (--nodes) depends on how your 
software is designed to run in parallel. It's important to understand if your job is built 
for a distributed environment or a shared-memory environment.

Most parallel software is multi-threaded, meaning it's designed to run on a single computer 
and use multiple cores that share the same memory. If this describes your workflow, you 
should almost always set --nodes=1 and then set --ntasks to the number of independent tasks 
your job can run at the same time. Requesting more cores than your application can actually 
use will not speed it up and only wastes resources.

Some advanced applications (often using MPI) are designed to run across multiple, separate 
computers at once, communicating over the network. Only if your software is specifically 
built for this should you set `--nodes` to a value greater than one.


### Selecting memory for Your Job

Correctly estimating memory (--mem) can be tricky, but it is critical for ensuring your job 
runs successfully. Requesting too little will cause your job to fail, while requesting too 
much can increase your queue time and cost.

A good starting point is to calculate the size of the data your application needs to load 
into memory at one time. Once you have an estimate, it is safe practice to request about 
20% more memory than you think you need. This extra buffer accommodates the operating 
system and other side processes that run alongside your job.

The most reliable method is to run a short test job with a generous memory allocation and 
then check the actual peak usage. You can use the sacct command after your job finishes to 
see the MaxRSS (Maximum Resident Set Size). This will tell you precisely how much memory 
your job used, allowing you to make very accurate requests for future runs.

### Timing jobs

It is good practice to test a new workflow
by running small short jobs before submitting big long jobs.
To help plan your compute usage, 
it is helpful to time such test jobs.

Many well-designed applications display timing information
at the end of the log files they generate.
If this is not the case for your application,
you can find out how long a batch job takes
by sandwiching the commands you execute
between [`date`][date] commands:
[date]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html
```
date
<commands>
date
```
Your batch standard output file will then contain two "timestamps",
from which you can determine the running time.
To time a single command in a batch file, use [`time <command>`][time],
which will write timing information to standard output.
[time]: https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/time.1.html
