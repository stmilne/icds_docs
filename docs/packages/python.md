# Python

Several common software platforms, 
including Python (a widely used programming language), 
are highly extensible by loading packages.

Packages can be loaded within the application,
or before the application is launched by using a package manager.

## pip

`pip` is the package installer for Python.
To load Python packages, use `pip` with the option `--user`
(which directs Python to install the package for a single user):

```
pip install --user <package>
```

Sometimes, Python package libraries can become too large to store in the home directory.   
To remedy this, see [Quota issues in home](../getting-started/faq.md/#quota-issues-in-home).

## Anaconda

Python installations can also be managed with [Anaconda](./anaconda.md/#anaconda).

Anaconda offers a convenient way to build several different package environments which can 
be ideal for different per-project builds. It is usable with most popular scripting 
languages, including Python, R, and Julia.
