# Managing storage

## Group storage

Group storage access is controlled by membership in the corresponding collab group. 
To add and remove users from a collab group, 
the group owner can send a request to <icds@psu.edu>.

To customize group storage permissions, 
such as creating multiple collab groups or changing subdirectory permissions, 
contact <icds@psu.edu>.

## User-managed groups

If a group space owner wants direct control over group access,
or wants to designate a group coordinator, 
they may create a User Managed Group [(UMG)][UMG].

A UMG allows a group space owner to manage the group access list and group roles 
via [Penn State Accounts Management](https://accounts.psu.edu/manage). 
To create a UMG, select the following options:
[UMG]: https://pennstate.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0011865&sys_kb_id=81102ada87cedd10d7bf7485dabb35b0&spa=1
```
Group Function:     Functional
Campus:             University Park
Display Name:       icds.rc.<umg_name>
                    e.g. icds.rc.abc1234_collab
Email:              Not necessary for RC use
Security:           Sync with Enterprise Active Directory is required
```

ICDS filters UMGs for display names that begin with `icds.rc.`, 
so any UMGs created with this prefix will automatically appear on Roar. 
It may take up to 15 minutes for a newly created UMG to appear. 
To verify that a UMG is available, run the following command:

```
$ getent group icds.rc.<umg_name>
```

After a UMG is created, the owner can submit a request to <icds@psu.edu> 
to associate this UMG with the `<owner>_collab` group. 
Then the group owner has control over access and roles of the `<owner>_collab` group,
by modifying the UMG membership, without contacting ICDS.
(Note: users added as UMG members must have an active Roar account 
to access data.)
